# Video chat using socket.io, peerjs, express, uuid and ejs

In this project I used the socket.io, peerjs and express packages to develop a video chat similar to zoom. 
In addition to these packages, 
I also used the ejs template engine and uuid to generate random ids for different chats.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ManuelismoXp/video-chat-with-express-peerjs-and-socket.io.git

cd video-chat-with-express-peerjs-and-socket.io

npm i

npm run dev
```

In another terminal 

```bash
cd video-chat-with-express-peerjs-and-socket.io

npm i -g peer

peerjs --port 3001
```
